NEAT for Pac-Man (NES)

This is an implemetaion of the NEAT algorithm (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) for the game Pac-Man.
These Lua scripts can be used with the BizHawk emulator with a copy of Pac-Man for the NES.

This was my final project for a machine learning class I took for my undergrad degree.

Here's a video of some of the more successful iterations:
